                <h2>About me</h2>
                    <p>
                        As a student of Wrocław University of Science and Technology, majoring in cybersecurity,
                        I have experience with programming languages every day. I was learning, and I am still learning,
                        them during univeristy courses and I was developed them on my own. My cup off tea is trying to figure
                        why code doesn't work and my greatest satisfaction comes from fixing broken one.I am open to both new programming languages and technologies,
                        because I believe that the most important thing a person can do is developing himself.

                    </p>
